      <h2>Next Analytical Steps</h2>
      <p>
        The owner cost-burden chart suggests that the story did not end with the decade
        of data on this page. Starting around 2018, Fergus Falls and Otter Tail County
        move from comfortably below the Hennepin and Minneapolis owner cost-burden rates
        to meeting or even exceeding the metro on the share of owners paying 30 percent
        or more of income on housing. The next analytical step is to bring in more local
        context: parcel-level assessment or sales data to see whether prices are being
        driven by lakefront or investor activity, building permits and housing starts to
        gauge how much new supply has come online, and mortgage or property tax records
        to understand how rising interest rates and assessments are affecting monthly
        costs.

        Pairing those quantitative sources with local information such as zoning changes,
        major employers expanding or closing, and any surge in short-term rentals would
        help form concrete hypotheses about why rural owner households became more
        cost-burdened after 2018. From there, the county could test specific policy
        levers, such as targeted down-payment assistance, tax relief, or new
        construction incentives, and use similar dashboards to monitor whether those
        interventions are working.
