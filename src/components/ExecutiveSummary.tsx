      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This dashboard summarizes how housing affordability has changed in Fergus Falls
        and Otter Tail County compared with Minneapolis and Hennepin County from 2013 to
        2023, using ACS 5-year estimates and HUD Fair Market Rents. The central question
        is whether Otter Tail's traditional affordability advantage over the Twin Cities
        is shrinking, stable, or growing, and which households, renters or owners, are
        most affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the period, Otter Tail and Fergus Falls remain more affordable than
        Minneapolis and Hennepin on the main metrics. Median home values and rents are
        lower, price-to-income ratios are roughly 3.0 to 3.3 versus 3.6 to 4.1 in the
        metro, and renters in Otter Tail spend the smallest share of income on rent
        (around 14 to 15 percent versus about 20 percent in Minneapolis). Owner
        cost-burdened shares are highest in Minneapolis and lowest in Fergus Falls, with
        Otter Tail and Hennepin in between. At the same time, median home values have
        risen sharply everywhere, roughly 50 to 66 percent over the decade, with the
        fastest growth in the metro but substantial increases even in rural Otter Tail.
        HUD 2-bedroom FMRs generally track observed rents where the underlying files are
        usable, but some recent HUD workbooks are malformed and safely skipped.

        Taken together, the findings suggest that Otter Tail still offers a meaningful
        affordability advantage over the Twin Cities, especially for homeowners, but that
        rural households are not insulated from rising housing costs. The charts on this
        page translate these metrics into clear time-series views so county staff and
        other non-technical stakeholders can quickly see where local households are more
        or less strained than their metro counterparts and where further analysis or
        policy action might be warranted.
